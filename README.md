# Code and Design Decisions

<!-- Please document your code & design decisions here. -->

* in a more complex application I'd use redux (although it was said not to use)
* notes about flex box usage... slash responsiveness
* paginate responses
* better address formatting (Title Casing, abbreviations for Boulevard to cut down on wrapped lines)
* 375 width and 1180 width are according to comps. didn't have enough time to handle responsiveness perfectly between those widths.
